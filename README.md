<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT:
 -->

## About the project

Many projects lack sufficient development and preparation in the area of their
environment and sometimes are not intended as such at all due to the overall complexity,
time-consuming and non-adaptive nature of such a process[^1].

With this project, all you have to do is run some scripts, edit the necessary data
and add your own basic project plugins and you will have a fully customized project
from an open source perspective, ready for a development environment not only for
you but for others as well.

<!-- BUILT WITH:
