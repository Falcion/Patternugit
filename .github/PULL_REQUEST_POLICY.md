Learn about pull requests (hereinafter referred to as "PR" or "PRs" in the plural)
on this repository and our policy around them, PRs communicate changes to a branch
in a repository. Once a pull request is opened, you can review changes with collaborators
and add follow-up commits.

# About pull requests

A pull request (or "PR") is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch
into another, in a PR, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of
changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase.

PRs display the differences, or diffs, between the content in the source branch
and the content in the target branch.

> [!Note]
> When working with pull requests, keep the following in mind:
>
> - If you're working in the shared repository model, we recommend that you use a
>   topic branch for your pull request: while you can send pull requests from any
>   branch or commit, with a topic branch you can push follow-up commits if you
>   need to update your proposed changes.\
>   <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models/>
> - Be very careful when force pushing commits to a pull request, force pushing
>   changes the repository history and can corrupt your pull request, if other collaborators
>   branch the project before a force push, the force push may overwrite commits

    that collaborators based their work on.
