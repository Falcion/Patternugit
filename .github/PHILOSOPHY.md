Let's start with the simplest and most introductory essence of the philosophy of
the PATTERNU project - it defines the philosophy of those projects that use things
surrounding its philosophy (scripts, CI/CD, etc.) if they have not designated their
own philosophy in the same document, i.e. PATTERNU designates a template of philosophical
and program behavior for these projects, this is one of its fundamental
aspirations - to arrange what is not arranged initially and what a potential developer
(or creator) does not want to arrange, a ready-made infrastructure, an idea, documentation
on all planes.

PATTERNU perceives that each project is to some extent individual, that each developer
is even more individual, therefore it does not try to impose, but only to designate
and indicate.

**What does it mean?**

The project is trying to provide such functionality that if you forgot to configure
something, specify it separately, or mark it, then PATTERNU will directly indicate
it to you, or will make it so that you actually did not worry about it to one degree
or another. Its main goal is to simplify the initial stage of the project's life,
and not to replace the business process of the project in general, it does not try
to build itself more than a project "template", this is not its goal, its goal is
to become a project for other projects and allow people who are not interested in
DevOps, writing basic documentation, etc. to cross the threshold of open-source
frameworks and professional features and do what most programmers love - programming.

All those things that form the basis of the project, its life cycle - are an integral
part of the project itself, but they do not necessarily have to be "independent",
"brilliant", self-written - their miracle is that they can be taken from others and
shared. PATTERNU tries to "comprehend" such a thought in the absolute, including
in the form of this philosophy - all those things that surround the future project
that uses this template, develop this philosophy and the project itself does not
necessarily have its own philosophy, it is enough for it to have a goal and functionality,
and the role of a philosopher will be taken by the PATTERNU project.

We do not delve into analytical, classical philosophy, metaphysics and others because
PATTERNU sets applied philosophy as its goal, i.e. its direct function is a worldview
or simply reasoning.

## Basic principles

### 1. **Simplify the initial stage**

PATTERNU aims to make the first steps in project development as easy as possible:

- If you forgot to specify or configure something, PATTERNU will remind you about
  it.
- If you do not want to deal with DevOps, CI/CD setup or writing basic documentation,
  PATTERNU will take this work on itself.
- PATTERNU creates a ready-made infrastructure that allows you not to worry about
  basic processes, focusing on writing code.

### 2. **No more than a template**

PATTERNU does not try to replace your project's business processes or impose strict
frameworks. This is exactly a *template* that offers:

- Basic tools and recommendations for a start.
- Documentation and examples for understanding.
- Flexibility for customization to individual needs.

### 3. **Philosophy for other projects**

PATTERNU realizes that not every project needs its own philosophy. Instead, it
provides a *philosophy template* that can be used as a basis:

- A project only needs a goal and functionality.
- PATTERNU takes care of the philosophical aspects, allowing the developer to
  focus on the code.

### 4. **The idea of ​​sharing**

PATTERNU supports the concept of sharing:

- Use ready-made solutions when possible.
- Share your improvements with others.
- Don't be afraid to borrow tools and practices that have already proven their effectiveness.

## Why do we need applied philosophy?

PATTERNU is based on the idea of ​​*applied philosophy*, avoiding complex analytical
theories and metaphysics. We focus on:

- A worldview that helps organize projects.
- Practical reasoning on how to make development more convenient.

## How to use PATTERNU?

1. **For developers who want to focus on programming.**
PATTERNU removes the need for you to do basic project setup.

2. **For projects that want simplified management.**
Use built-in templates for CI/CD, documentation, and repository organization.

3. **For open-source enthusiasts.**
PATTERNU helps you overcome the entry threshold by providing ready-made tools for
publishing and maintaining a project.

## Conclusion

PATTERNU is a template not only for code, but also for ideas. It is a project that
helps other projects find their structure and philosophy. Choose PATTERNU to focus
on what is important to you: writing code, creating features, and developing your
idea. We have already prepared the rest.
