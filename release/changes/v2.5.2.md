# Patternugit — Release Notes

**Version:** 2.5.2\
**Release date:** 2025-08-12\
**PR:** [https://github.com/Falcion/Patternugit/pull/353](https://github.com/Falcion/Patternugit/pull/353)\
**Compare:** [https://github.com/Falcion/Patternugit/compare/v2.5.1...v2.5.2](https://github.com/Falcion/Patternugit/compare/v2.5.1...v2.5.2)

## Executive summary

This routine release prepares the repository for more stable dependency management
and cleans up project configuration. The main work reorganizes dependencies between
production and development categories, removes duplicated dependency entries that
caused divergent version installs and slow preparation, and updates Dependabot configuration
to follow the new CODEOWNERS review requirement. Several dev tooling bumps and small
config fixes are included.

**Why this matters:**\
fixes long `prepare`/`install` times caused by duplicated dependency
entries, reduces dependency-version drift across environments, and aligns Dependabot
with GitHub's updated infrastructure requiring CODEOWNERS reviews.

## Highlights

* Fixed duplicated dependency entries ("clones") that caused async (mismatched)
  versions across `dependencies` and `devDependencies`, reducing install/prep time. (See commit `fd77133af2135e52701f4769099b6e35c14cb492`.)
* Dependabot config cleaned — removed stale `reviewers` entries; Dependabot now
  relies on the repository `CODEOWNERS` for required reviews in accordance with
  GitHub’s changes.
* Several development dependencies bumped to address linting, test and
  formatting/tooling stability.

## ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

* **dependencies:** Fixed dependency tree in `package.json`. This is a structural
  change that may alter resolved versions for some transitive packages — consumers
  should run a full install and CI tests before releasing downstream. (Fix for #341)
* **textlint:** `textlint-editorconfig` rule was removed. If you relied on that
  specific rule, update your local textlint rules accordingly.

## Files / config changes of note

### Dependabot config

Removed `reviewers` entries to align with CODEOWNERS-based review requirement.

**Important:** Dependabot will now require review only via `CODEOWNERS` — make
sure CODEOWNERS is up to date for teams that should approve dependency PRs. See

## Migration / Upgrade instructions (for integrators and maintainers)

1. **Pull the tag or PR into your feature branch**

   * `git fetch --tags origin`
   * `git checkout -b upgrade/deps-v2.5.2 origin/v2.5.2` (or merge PR #353)

2. **Fresh install & lockfile regeneration (recommended)**

   * Remove node\_modules and current lockfile:

     * `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json yarn.lock`
   * Install to regenerate a clean lockfile from the corrected dependency tree:

     * `npm ci` (preferred if using npm + package-lock.json)
     * or `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` as appropriate

3. **Run full test + lint steps**

   * `npm run test`
   * `npm run lint`
   * `npm run build` (if applicable)

4. **CI validation**

   * Confirm CI matrix runs (node versions used by this project). If CI fails due to different dependency resolution, regenerate the lockfile and re-run CI.

5. **If you used the removed `textlint-editorconfig` rule**

   * Update textlint configuration to replace the removed rule with an equivalent or remove references to it.

6. **Dependabot reviewers**

   * Ensure `CODEOWNERS` contains the list of approvers you want for dependency PRs. Dependabot will follow CODEOWNERS going forward.

## Rollback plan

If a regression is detected and you need to revert:

1. Revert the PR: `git revert <merge-commit-of-PR-353>` and push a hotfix branch; or
2. Restore the previous tag: `git checkout tags/v2.5.1 -b rollback/to-v2.5.1` then publish a follow-up patch.
3. Re-run lockfile regeneration and CI as in the Migration steps.

## Risk assessment & testing notes

* **Risk:** Dependency version resolution may change for transitive modules after removing duplicated entries. Some dev-time-only packages moved from `dependencies` → `devDependencies` (or vice-versa) can change installed artifact sets in production image builds.
* **Mitigation:** Regenerate lockfile and run full integration tests; run production container builds to ensure no missing runtime deps.
* **Testing performed:** lint fixes, hook reformatting verified; dependency tree corrected per commit `fd77133...`; tool bumps verified in local CI. Maintain release candidate builds and smoke test on staging before promoting to production.

## Notable issues closed

* Closes #313 — Dependabot reviewers field removed.
* Closes #341 — Fixed duplicate dependency entries and dependency tree.
* Closes #342 — Husky hook fixes and versionrc fixes.
* Closes #340 — PR template typo fix.
* Closes #344–#352 — package updates aggregated.
