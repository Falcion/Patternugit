# v2.5.1 - PATTERNU's patch release

This patch goes around two things before release of super-linter's ESLINTv9 support:

- inject into the commitlint's config patterns to ignore dependabot's pull requests
  and commits, this feat would allow dependabot not to throw explicit errors regarding
  it's committing style (massive descriptions, links and refs).

```javascript
/**
 Ignores:
 * @type: dependabot
 * @description since dependabot is an automated system which is important in terms not only
 *              tracking updates, but security issues too, it is acceptable to ignore issues
 *              with it's commit naming
 *
 * @param {*} message entirety of commit message (header+description)
 * @returns Boolean value which shows, would commit be ignored or not
 */
(message) =>
/^(build|chore|deps|ci)\([^)]+\): bump (?:@?[\w-]+(?:\/[\w-]+)*|.+ from [\w.-]+ to [\w.-]+)$/gm.test(message),
(message) =>
/^(build|chore|deps|ci)\([^)]+\): bump the [\w-]+ group with \d+ updates?$/gim.test(message),
```

> [!Note]
> Commitlint also ignores messages by repo-visualizer[^1] and imgbot[^2], but they
> were not main problem and headache of this repository's pipeline.

- update dependabot's config with more advanced policy about commits/requets naming
  and fix an issue with reviewer (affects only this repository, if you use this rep
  as template, you would still rename reviewer in config - fixing the issue).
- update many security issues (severities) and packages.
