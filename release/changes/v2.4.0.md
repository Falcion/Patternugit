# v2.4.0 Release Notes

**Template Repositories & LFS Improvements**

- Fixed template repository availability by removing problematic LFS handling
- Large files are now treated as binaries (no automatic LFS conversion)
- Added pre-commit hook to warn about staging files marked for LFS (terminal-only output)
- Improved bash script handling (executable bits, docs, and automation)

This version removes LFS constraints for templates while adding safeguards via hooks and script enhancements. The changes prioritize stability and developer visibility.
